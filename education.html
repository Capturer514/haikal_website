        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My education journey throughout my life is when I landed in Tadika Krista in 2007 in my house at Wangsa Maju. It was my first step towards pre-school education where my learning had begun. I also moved to another pre-school called C.E.C Real Kids around the same area where I spent 2 years. It was a fun experience for me as I had played games, learned new things and swam in the school’s swimming pool. There was also a rabbit hutch beside the school where I get to play with the rabbits.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, I moved to my first primary school in Taman P. Ramlee in Kuala Lumpur. It was called Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Mun Yee. The school’s entire population consisted mostly of Chinese children, with Malay and Indian being the minority. My mother wanted me to learn Mandarin at the school because she was also taught at a Chinese school during her childhood. I studied at this school alongside my older sister. </p>
        
        <p>Moreover, my family moved to Bangi in 2010 where I moved to another school. It was called Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Seri Putra where it was located in a township called Bandar Seri Putra. The school was fairly new. It was an entirely new experience for me and gave me a culture shock because it was my first time stepping foot inside a Malay school. I struggled to make friends because I did not know how to interact with them. I spent three years inside the school from 2011 to 2014 where I moved to another school called Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Bukit Mahkota.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, after finishing my primary school education, I started my high school education in Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bandar Seri Putra during 2016. It was one of the most coming-of-age experiences that I have ever endured during my time there. I experienced loyalty, betrayals, heartbreak and victories that helped shaped me into the person that I am today. It was also where I reconnected with an old friend named Muhammad Hakimi bin Azhari. We quickly became best friends due to our common interests and shared values.</p>
        
        <p>After graduating high school, I pursued Information Management at Universiti Teknologi Mara at Negeri Sembilan, Rembau where it was also the location of my grandparents’ house near Dun Kota. It was located between Kampung Pilin and Tampin. My family was really grateful that I managed to land in this campus due to the strategic location and the advantages I have with my family.</p>
