        <h2>About My Friends</h2>
        <p>Friends are the people we made along the way. One of my friends is Hakimi. Iâ€™ve known him since standard 4 in 2013 and we have known together for more than 10 years. I have grown incredibly close to him, getting to know each of his family members and having meals with them as well. I also have been called an uncle by his family, especially from his niece whose name is Aina.</p>
            <p>Also, another friend I have is Danish Afif, whom I have grown close with. He currently studies at Universiti Kuala Lumpur in Information Technology and has graduated his diploma there. I also used to play video games with him especially mulitplayers. One of the games I played with him is Team Fortress 2 and League of Legends.
            </p>
            <p>I also met up with Hakimi's college friends from Internation Islamic University Malaysia at Pagoh. He is studying English Communication with them. One of them is Izzul and Hariz.</p>
